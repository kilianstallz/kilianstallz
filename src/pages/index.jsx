          You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands? That's how you're gonna feel
          every day. My mother cried the day I was born because she knew sheâ€™d never be prettier than me. You should
          make me your campaign manager. I was born for politics. I have great hair and I love lying. Captain? The kids
          want to know where Paulie the Pigeon is. I told them he got sucked up into an airplane engine, is that all
          right?
